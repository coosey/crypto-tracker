  market_cap_name: "Market Cap = Current Price x Circulating Supply",
  market_cap_description: "Refers to the total market value of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply. It is similar to the stock market’s measurement of multiplying price per share by shares readily available in the market (not held & locked by insiders, governments)",
  volume: "A measure of how much of a cryptocurrency was traded in the last 24 hours.",
  fdv_name: "Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) = Current Price x Total Supply",
  fdv_desc: "Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) is the theoretical market capitalization of a coin if the entirety of its supply is in circulation, based on its current market price. The FDV value is theoretical as increasing the circulating supply of a coin may impact its market price. Also depending on the tokenomics, emission schedule or lock-up period of a coin's supply, it may take a significant time before its entire supply is released into circulation.",
  circulating_supply: "The amount of coins that are circulating in the market and are tradeable by the public. It is comparable to looking at shares readily available in the market (not held & locked by insiders, governments).",
  total_supply_desc: "The amount of coins that have already been created, minus any coins that have been burned (removed from circulation). It is comparable to outstanding shares in the stock market.",
  total_supply_name: "Total Supply = Onchain supply - burned tokens",
  max_supply_name: "Max Supply = Theoretical maximum as coded",
  max_supply_desc: "The maximum number of coins coded to exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency. It is comparable to the maximum number of issuable shares in the stock market."
